## Overview

A landing page built for the cat-themed web3 project Nekoverse. Nekoverse is a platform for web3 community to interact with other feline enthusiasts through interactive games, community challenges, and special events. The single-page website highlights the project features, scheduled timelines, and a section for purchasing and staking initial coin offerings of $NEKO token. This project aims to challenge the website designs of the existing meme coin webpages that are static, plain, and unresponsive in nature. It also serves as a personal and non-academic survey tool for assessing the influence of website interactivity and animation in attracting cryptocurrency investors and stakeholders.
